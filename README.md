# Node2Agents  

Node2Agents is a web application that allows users to visually design agent-based systems using a node-based interface. The designed agents and behaviors are then converted into executable code using [SPADE](https://github.com/javipalanca/spade), a multi-agent system framework.  

## Features  

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Create and connect agents and behaviors easily.  
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Convert visual models into executable Python SPADE code.  
- **Customizable Behaviors**: Define different types of behaviors, such as one-shot, cyclic, and periodic.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: React, React Flow  
- **Backend**: Flask, SPADE
